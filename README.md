MetaSocialEnterprise
====================

Our Spacecraft

The idea is to build a really trustable meta social network based on open source, distribution and open standard ideas.
You can find a taste of those concepts on https://github.com/e14n and in our wiki.
We need money to mantain a basic kernel of the product and open it to the crowd so please... http://www.gofundme.com/7b6nlk
We do this stuff just for fun so don't get too excited.
Merry Christmas.
